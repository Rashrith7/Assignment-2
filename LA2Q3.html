    <h1>The Role of Railways in Modern Society</h1>

    <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
    <p>
        Railways have played a <span class="highlight">crucial role</span> in shaping modern civilization. 
        Since their inception during the industrial revolution, they have revolutionized transportation. 
        Railways enabled the efficient movement of goods and people across long distances. 
        This significantly contributed to economic growth and urbanization. 
        Historical events, such as the expansion of trade routes, were made possible due to railway networks. 
        Moreover, they facilitated cultural exchange by connecting distant regions. 
        Today, they remain a symbol of progress and development. 
        The historical significance of railways continues to influence modern transportation systems.

    <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Railways contribute greatly to the <span class="highlight">economy</span> by promoting trade and commerce. 
        They provide an efficient and cost-effective mode of transporting goods. 
        Industries rely on railways for the supply of raw materials and distribution of finished products. 
        Additionally, railways generate employment opportunities and boost tourism. 
        Economic corridors developed around railway lines stimulate regional development. 
        The efficiency of freight transportation reduces costs, benefiting businesses and consumers alike. 
        As a result, railways play a vital role in sustaining economic growth and development worldwide.
    </p>

    <h2>Environmental Benefits</h2>
    <p>
        Railways offer <span class="highlight">environmentally friendly</span> transportation solutions. 
        Compared to road and air transport, trains produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions. 
        Electric trains, in particular, contribute to reducing air pollution. 
        Railways also help in minimizing road congestion, leading to less fuel consumption. 
        Efficient land use and lower noise pollution further add to their environmental benefits. 
        As sustainability becomes a global priority, railways serve as a key component of green transportation. 
        Investing in railway infrastructure is crucial for building an eco-friendly future.
